# Metrics Dictionary (BI)

Este documento define as métricas canônicas usadas nos dashboards do projeto.
Todas as consultas usam apenas modelos dbt finais (`fact_`, `dim_`, `marts.analytics`), sem `raw`.

## Convenções globais
- **Jogos válidos**: `home_goals IS NOT NULL AND away_goals IS NOT NULL`.
- **Ordenação temporal**: `date_day ASC` para histórico e `date_day DESC, match_id DESC` para “recente”.
- **Escopo padrão**: `competition_key`/`competition_sk` e `season_label`.

---

## 1) Ranking Mensal

**Nome**: `ranking_mensal`  
**Descrição**: ranking por time/mês com pontos, vitórias, empates, derrotas, saldo, gols pró e gols contra.  
**Grão**: `competição + temporada + ano + mês + time`  
**Filtros padrão**:
- `competition_key` obrigatório
- `season_label` obrigatório
- somente meses com `matches > 0`
**Fórmula**:
- `points = wins * 3 + draws`
- `goal_diff = goals_for - goals_against`
**Fontes dbt**:
- `marts.analytics.team_monthly_stats`
- `marts.core.fact_matches` (quando filtrar competição)
**Notas / edge cases**:
- empate em ranking: ordenar por `points DESC, goal_diff DESC, goals_for DESC, team_name ASC`.

### SQL canônico
```sql
SELECT
  tms.competition_key,
  tms.season_label,
  tms.season,
  tms.year,
  tms.month,
  tms.team_name,
  tms.matches,
  tms.wins,
  tms.draws,
  tms.losses,
  tms.points,
  tms.goal_diff,
  tms.goals_for,
  tms.goals_against
FROM mart.team_monthly_stats tms
WHERE tms.competition_key = :competition_key
  AND tms.season_label = :season_label
  AND tms.matches > 0
ORDER BY
  tms.year::int DESC,
  tms.month::int DESC,
  tms.points DESC,
  tms.goal_diff DESC,
  tms.goals_for DESC,
  tms.team_name ASC;
```

## 2) Forma Recente

**Nome**: `forma_recente`  
**Descrição**: desempenho dos últimos `N` jogos de cada time.  
**Grão**: `time` (com base nos últimos N jogos por time)  
**Filtros padrão**:
- `N` configurável (`:n_games`, padrão sugerido `5`)
- `competition_key` obrigatório
- `season_label` obrigatório
- somente jogos válidos
**Fórmula**:
- por jogo: `W=3`, `D=1`, `L=0`
- agregado recente: soma de pontos, vitórias, empates, derrotas, gols pró/contra
**Fontes dbt**:
- `marts.core.fact_matches`
- `marts.core.dim_team`
**Notas / edge cases**:
- desempate recente: `points_last_n DESC, goal_diff_last_n DESC, goals_for_last_n DESC`.

## 3) Desempenho Casa/Fora

**Nome**: `desempenho_casa_fora`  
**Descrição**: comparação de performance como mandante vs visitante por time.  
**Grão**: `temporada + time + contexto (home/away)`  
**Filtros padrão**:

**Fontes dbt**:
- `marts.core.fact_matches`
- `marts.core.dim_team`
**Notas / edge cases**:
- contexto fechado: `home` ou `away`.

### SQL canônico

## 4) Gols por Minuto (Buckets)

**Nome**: `gols_por_minuto_bucket`  
**Descrição**: distribuição de gols por faixa de minuto.  
**Grão**: `temporada + bucket_minuto`  
**Filtros padrão**:
- `competition_key` obrigatório
- `season_label` obrigatório
- somente eventos de gol (`is_goal = true`)
- minutos válidos (`time_elapsed` não nulo)

  - `00-15`, `16-30`, `31-45`, `46-60`, `61-75`, `76-90`, `91-105`, `106-120`
**Fontes dbt**:
- `marts.core.fact_match_events`
- `marts.core.fact_matches`
**Notas / edge cases**:
- usa `time_elapsed` (não soma acréscimo de `time_extra` no bucket principal).

## Alinhamento com dashboards versionados
- Dashboards alvo:
  - `Ranking Mensal`
  - `Forma Recente`
  - `Desempenho Casa/Fora`
  - `Gols por Minuto`
- Para manter consistência, os filtros padrão acima devem ser replicados nas perguntas/cards do Metabase.
